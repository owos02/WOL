# WOL (How much time you wasted in League of Legends)
How much time you wasted in League of Legends (Friend Request)

It was made for a friend.

Usage is simple. You run the Code. It asks you to input a UserLink in the first Box | Looks like this: 'https://wol.gg/stats/euw/{USERNAME}/'
Then a UserName that will be displayed in the Programm (Nothing more)

And then everything should be automated.

If you press on your Username it will redirect you to the Website you inputted.

Looks like shit i know.
